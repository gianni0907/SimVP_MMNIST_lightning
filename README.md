# SimVP_MMNIST_lightning
PyTorch lightning implementation of SimVP architecture. The Colab Notebook contains an implementation of [SimVPv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12509), [SimVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05099), and an instantiation of SimVPv2 using the [PoolFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11418). The dataset used for the experiments is the Moving MNIST, considering sequences 10 input frames and 10 output frames to predict.

The Colab Notebook is accessible also [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LB8MhplEYMUidg0RZMNTCT_aaV5QTiCv?usp=sharing)
Large parts of the non-lightning code are taken from the model zoo of [OpenSTL](https://github.com/chengtan9907/OpenSTL)
